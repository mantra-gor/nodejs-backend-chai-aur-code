# Play Backend Development

This repository serves as a learning project for backend development using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The aim is to develop a backend system for a video playback application named Play, which is a clone of YouTube. The project is inspired by the tutorials provided by Chai Aur Code, particularly the teachings of Hitesh Choudhary.

## About Play

Play is a video playback application designed to mimic the functionality of YouTube. Through this project, we aim to understand the fundamentals of backend development, including user authentication, video storage, retrieval, and other essential features required for a video playback platform.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment used for building scalable network applications.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, providing robust features for building APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database system used for storing and managing data, particularly suited for scalable and flexible applications.
<!-- - **Chai Aur Code:** A learning resource providing tutorials and guides for various programming concepts, including backend development. -->
